## 💡 Tips

- **First load:** Side Panel must open once to initialize AI

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**AI not available?**
```
chrome://on-device-internals/
→ Check Gemini Nano status
→ Should be "Ready" or "Downloading"
```

**Popup broken?**
```
F12 in popup → Check console errors
```

**Features not working?**
```
1. Open Side Panel first (click "Open Full Analysis")
2. Wait for AI to initialize
3. Try feature again
```
